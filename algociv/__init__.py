# Versions follow this simple format of their number:
# DEVELOPMENT VERSION-MAJOR.MINOR.BUG FIXES/OPTIMIZATIONS
# So for example, ALPHA 1.2.4 means:
# - This is currently in alpha
# - There has been one major release,
# - There has been 2 minor releases associated with the major release 1.
# - There are 4 bug fixes/optimizations associated with the minor release 2.

__version__ = "ALPHA-1.0.0"
