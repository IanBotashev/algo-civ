# Notes

## Structures
Structures can be built upon values.
Structures are not able to move, but can interact
with other units around it.

The farther away a unit is from the structure,
the more energy it takes to actually interact with the unit.
This is so, a structure at 0, 0 cannot interact
with a unit at 10000, 10000

Structures can interact with units in these ways:
 - Mine
 - Build
 
Each Structure has it's own energy capacity.
Energy can be transferred to the structures.

Should there be a "memory" variable? This could limit the structure 
from being overpowered, like creating it's own energy while also
building more things. But how should this work?

No. Energy capacity already does that, i just need to fully figure out how Mining, Building, and getting energy works.
